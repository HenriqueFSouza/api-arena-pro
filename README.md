I've updated the README.md file with:

1. Kept the NestJS logo for visual identity
2. Added comprehensive documentation of all API features
3. Included detailed endpoint listings
4. Described data models and business rules
5. Maintained the important setup and running instructions
6. Added security features and error handling sections
7. Kept the MIT license reference

The documentation now provides a clear overview of the system while maintaining the professional look of the original README. Would you like me to make any adjustments to the documentation?
